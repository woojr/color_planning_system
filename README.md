# Color Planning System

This repository contains the implementation for a color planning system that models colorâ€“emotion associations using color appearance attributes. 

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project explores how perceptual attributes of color relate to human emotional responses. A set of regression models are used to predict semantic emotion values based on color appearance attributes such as lightness, chroma, and hue structure.
